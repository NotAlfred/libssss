Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme

This is a port of [point-at-infinity](http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/index.html) with minor modifications so it's buildable



/*
 *
 *
 * This is an implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. See
 * the project's homepage http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/ for more
 * information on this topic.
 *
 * This code links against the GNU multiprecision library "libgmp".
 * I compiled the code successfully with gmp 4.1.4.
 * You will need a system that has a /dev/random entropy source.
 *
 * Compile with
 * "gcc -O2 -lgmp -o ssss-split ssss.c && ln ssss-split ssss-combine"
 *
 * Compile with -DNOMLOCK to obtain a version without memory locking.
 *
 * Report bugs to: ssss AT point-at-infinity.org
